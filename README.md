# This Project is Now Deprecated

As of [Mocha 1.18.0](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/blob/master/History.md#1180--2014-03-13), Mocha has built-in promise support! Hooray!!

As such, this project is no longer necessary, and I'm deprecating it. Issues and pull requests are now closed. The code is still sticking around ([in GitHub history](https://github.com/domenic/mocha-as-promised/tree/7714899e5b5bc2da28964b928683c26bf131e520)); all the releases are still up on npm; etc. But the project will no longer be maintained.

It was a good two years guys! But I'm glad it's all unnecessary now.
